## Login / Account Creation (Subscriber Account Creation & Login)

1. Should users be able to log in using **either username or email, or just one?
2. What level of password complexity is required (e.g., symbols, length)?
3. How should session management be handled after login (e.g., Flask-Session)?
4. What happens if a duplicate username or email is submitted?



## Send Notification (Send New Notification to Subscribers)

1. Should notifications support HTML formatting (e.g., bold text, clickable links)?
2. Can staff send messages to a subset of subscribers (e.g., by group or tag)?
3. Can notifications be scheduled for future delivery?
4. What is the expected length limit for notification subject/body?



## Template Creation (Create and Save Notification Templates)

1. What **placeholders will be supported in templates (e.g., `{{firstName}}`, `{{pickupTime}}`)?
2. Should templates be pre-approved**, or can anyone on staff create one?
3. Can templates be edited after being saved, or only deleted and re-created?
4. Will there be categories or tags to organize templates?



## Review Log (Review Notification Log)

1. Should logs include **failed delivery attempts and error details?
2. How long should notification logs be retained before deletion (if at all)?
3. Can logs be filtered by date, sender, or keyword?
4. Who is authorized to view or manage the logs?
